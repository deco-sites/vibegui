We were _genuinely_ surprised with the amazing AI apps that you have created.</p><p>If you didn't manage to come, don't worry! Our next event, Draw in Sampa, will be announced very soon. Please comment here if you'd like to reserve your spot!</p><p>Immense praise to Maria Cecilia Marques and Giulia L. who pulled this event out of thin air in about 2 weeks — full with sponsorship and crowded with amazing people. You girls rock! I can't wait to announce our big AI event... 🤫</p><p>And as usual, you can take a look at all of the published apps in our community: https://lnkd.in/d889Fgjd</p>",
